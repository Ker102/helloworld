# Copilot Instructions for Hello World Blog Project

## Repository Overview

This is a simple blog page project currently featuring a "Hello World" page with potential to grow into a full-featured blog platform. The project is built using vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript without external dependencies.

## Project Structure

- `index.html` - Main HTML file containing the blog page structure, styles, and scripts
- `README.md` - Project documentation
- `ISSUES_IDEAS.md` - Feature ideas and development roadmap

## Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: Pure HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (vanilla, no frameworks)
- **Styling**: Embedded CSS with gradient backgrounds and responsive design
- **No build tools**: Direct HTML file that can be opened in any browser

## Development Guidelines

### Code Style

- Use semantic HTML5 elements
- Keep CSS organized within `<style>` tags in the head section
- Use consistent indentation (4 spaces)
- Follow a warm, cozy color scheme (browns, beiges) as established in the current design
- Write clean, readable JavaScript without dependencies

### Testing and Validation

- Test changes by opening `index.html` in a web browser
- Verify responsive design across different screen sizes
- Check browser console for any JavaScript errors
- Validate HTML structure and accessibility

### Making Changes

1. All styles are embedded in the HTML file - modify the `<style>` section
2. Structure changes go in the HTML body
3. Keep the warm, cozy aesthetic consistent with the current design
4. Ensure mobile responsiveness is maintained

## Browser Compatibility

Target evergreen browsers (latest versions of Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge). No IE support needed.

## Future Development

See `ISSUES_IDEAS.md` for planned features and enhancement ideas that would transform this into a full blog platform.
